Would anyone be interested in teaming up to develop a complex systems-themed app for iPhone or iPad? The idea is inspired by NSF's gorgeous Science360 app for iPad, as well as Movies Mobile from the New England Complex Systems Institute.

I, myself, do not know how to write an app, but apparently it can be done in 14 days. If anyone is interested, sign up (with a concept if you have one) and we can pull together a meeting soon.
