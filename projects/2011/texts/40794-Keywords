Hey Guys! Some of your research interests have been entered. Hopefully this can give us a better idea of what we are studying, and how we can collaborate for the final challenge. They are organized in a google doc.

Hey Again! Here are two versions of the GML. The first is non-editable, it works. The second can be messed around with like a normal sharable google doc. Please remember to cut and paste ALL of the text (No bracket left behind!) into a text editor of your choice (like notepad) and save it as a .gml. There is a code called "value", this is so you can manipulate the PeopleNodes and the SubjectNodes as separate variables. If you have trouble, let me know. Again, apologies for misspellings and mis-placing-you-in-the-mega-universe-of-stuff-to-study.
