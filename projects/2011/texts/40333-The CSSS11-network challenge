Today the Networks Module has started. One of the well-known examples of a network, is a social network.
Did you realize you have been working hard on an (almost) completely new social network in the past few days?

How do these networks come in to place? How do we make friends? Will we be a fully connected network? How many hubs do we have - and can we explain how these hubs come in to place?

This is an excellent opportunity to find some answers to these questions!

The idea is to base the results on the contacts people make. Simply put: who did you have a conversation with? By noting this regularly, we can see the connectedness and sorts of the network evolve over time.

The plan is to collect data on
1) The evolvement of the network over time, in terms of nr of contacts (conversations lasting over 10 minutes) per approx. 2 days 
2) The 'final' network, as in the people you feel connected to (would like to contact for science or social activities)

All results will be processed anonymously and will appear (at the end of the summerschool) on the wiki.

We need your help off course, to answer these questions. 
The first survey can be found at: www.thesistools.com/web/?id=20584

If you are interested in this project, I will organize some discussion meeting (probably in the next week). For now: add your name to the list below, and send in the survey! (while encouraging as much of your connections as you can to do so, tooÂ ;) )

If you have any questions, send a message to ehuk at rsm dot nl.

Thank you so much for your help!

Hey Guys! Some of your research interests have been entered. Hopefully this can give us a better idea of what we are studying, and how we can collaborate for the final challenge. They are organized in a google doc for sorting, searching etc, and all should have editing privileges. Sorry for typos!
