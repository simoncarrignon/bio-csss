I'd like to play around with the idea of using chaotic attractors to create music, as introduced by Liz Bradley.  If anyone else is interested, please say so below!  Ideally, I'd love to create a new piece of music (perhaps even recording a few of the budding musicians at the summer school if possible!), pull the individual parts of the composition apart and then use chaotic attractors to put them back together in new (and constantly evolving) ways.  I have music production software on my laptop that we can use as a backbone, but we'd need to work out how to program something so that the differential equations controlled it (or otherwise figure out how to use the DEs to make a composition that we then record within the software - perhaps an easier option!)  I'd like to hear other people's ideas about what elements of the piece the chaotic attractors could be used to manipulate - Liz's example only used them to re-order pitch, but I'm sure there are other things that we could do too.  Hopefully this could be a project that we could play with in our spare time - I'm also looking to join in with a more academic project too, but I think this could potentially be a very enjoyable side-project. -Martin Gould
