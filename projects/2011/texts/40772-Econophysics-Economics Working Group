Akira, Veronica and I have been discussing some econophysics-type problems recently, and we are going to set up a small working group to meet and discuss our work and problems that we've been thinking about.  We will be talking about using ideas from complex systems (such as agent-based modelling, statistical mechanics, etc.) to re-visit traditional problems from economics.  We haven't set a date for our first meeting yet, but it's likely to be early next week.  Please add your name to the list below if you'd like to come along, either to talk or just to listen!

I've had a chat with a couple of people today, and it seems like Monday 28th of June at 6pm could work for most people.  Would people be interested in trying out something a bit old-school: a blackboard session?  We see lots of Powerpoint presentations every day, so I thought this might mix things up a bit.  For those of us that want to speak (and it's completely fine if you'd like to come along and just listen), we could take it in turns either presenting some of our research or discussing a problem that we're facing in our work, and want some ideas on.  I think if we could keep it discussion-group style, this could be an excellent way of generating interdisciplinary ideas for everyone. - Martin
