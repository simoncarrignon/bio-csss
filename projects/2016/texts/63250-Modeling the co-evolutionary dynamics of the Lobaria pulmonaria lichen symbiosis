Summary
A comprehensive understanding of symbiotic interactions will require quantitative analysis of the hyperdiverse and largely unexplored lichen symbioses between endolichenic fungi (mostly Ascomycetes) and their photosynthetic hosts (i.e. photobionts), representing the best model of symbioses. The lichen symbiosis is an extremely successful nutritional mode in heterotrophic fungi (usually in the Phylum Ascomycota), allowing the fungi to obtain carbohydrate-rich resources directly from their photobiont partner, which can either be cyanobacteria, green algae, or in some cases both (Lutizoni & Miadlikowska 2009). This unique relationship has had such evolutionary and ecological success that that there are close to 14,000 species of lichens worldwide found from the poles to the tropics.

Lobaria pulmonaria is considered the best-studied lichen species worldwide from both an ecological and genetic point of view (Grube & Spribille 2012). The foliose lichen is distributed throughout Europe and parts of North America and grows on the bark of several tree species in old-growth forests. L. pulmonaria is a tripartite system consisting of an association among the green alga Dictyochloropsis reticulata, the cyanobacterium Nostoc sp., and its main fungal host in Europe, Lobaria (Dal Grande 2011). Recently, it has been shown that the mycobiont of L. pulmonaria is mostly dispersed together via vegetative propagules and thallus fragments (Werth et al. 2006), implicating long-term interaction in the symbiosis. In order to understand local adaptation and coevolution among symbionts, it is important to examine the genetic structure of lichen mycobionts and photobionts on a continental scale. The L. pulmonaria-D. reticulata symbiosis shows significant within-population genetic structure due to restricted gene flow and vertical photobiont transmission (i.e. thallus fragmentation). To study the population structure of the symbiotic system, the fungal and algal symbionts of 4,300 thalli from 142 European populations of Lobaria pulmonaria were genotyped at eight and seven micro satellite loci (data available). 

With this dataset, we plan to use a multi-pronged modeling approach to generate quantitative models of co-evolutionary endolichenic networks via NetLogo and a modification of the ECHO model, allowing us to better understand the mechanisms driving diversification among populations in the L. pulmonaria system. A complex adaptive systems approach has never been applied to any lichen model system and has the potential to provide a mechanistic understanding of why the Phylum Ascomycota are hyperdiverse. Determining the co-evolutionary relationship in the L. pulmonaria system will allow the scientific community to better understand the role of symbiotic interactions in the generation and maintenance of biodiversity in forest communities. 

There are a few datasets available (one without spatial information and another with spatial information).
