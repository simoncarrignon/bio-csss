Summary
Throwing this up to see if anyone is interested in working with financial time series. A few broad ideas are:

1.) Detecting market phase transitions

2.) I need to get a better understanding of delay coordinate embedding but it might be useful for pricing instruments with sparse data

3.) There may be an interesting trading strategy we can implement using some of the concepts that have come up in the program

It would be great to hear other ideas.
