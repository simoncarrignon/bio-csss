Summary
	The goal of this work is to show the potential of tight control over the the location in phase space of non-linear coupled chemical reaction networks via the manipulation of individual parameters. Chemical reactions, when sharing in a combination of products and reactants, can be represented by systems of nonlinear equations. Both reaction rate constants for each involved reaction and the abundance of open system components can be manipulated as parameters. After a purely mathematical investigation of various coupled reaction motifs, two applied systems (one biotic, the other abiotic) will be investigated for their ability both respond to, and drive, phase space location respectively.
