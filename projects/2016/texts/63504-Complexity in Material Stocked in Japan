Summary
Fishman et al. (2014) have developed a database of the mass of materials stocked in buildings and infrastructure for all of Japan, at a scale of 1km^2 and 10km^2. Looking at a map of the mass of stocked materials (see figures from Tanikawa et al. 2015), there are clear links to complexity (i.e., scaling and fractals). The overall objective of the project is to explore the complexity inherent in materials stocked in Japan. This could allow us to make links to physical infrastructure growth and the mass of cities.

We currently have GIS data for 2009 (buildings) and 2010 (infrastructure). We have reached out to the authors of the study to see about gaining access to the full time series. Below are the research questions for each option:

Analysis with 2009/2010 data:

Is there a scaling nature of stocked materials in Japanese cities? Is there scaling with respect to population, city rank, and other indicators? Does the spatial definition of "city" impact scaling?
What is the fractal nature of stocked material in Japanese cities?
Analysis with time series:
(could brainstorm potential approaches with or without data)

Apply non-linear techniques to an econometric analysis of socio-economic analysis of material stock accumulation
Investigate the fractal nature of material accumulation over time
Track physical growth of specific cities after a catastrophic event (i.e., severe bombing in cities during World War 2)
