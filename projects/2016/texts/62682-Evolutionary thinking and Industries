Economy evolves. In 1982, Nelson and Winter proposed an evolutionary theory in economic change. The same mechanism of variation, replication and selection from Darwinian theory could be well applied to the change of economic structures. I am interested in applying the so called Universal Darwinian theory on industries. From a similar but more specific perspective, Richard Dawkins proposed the concepts of genes as the replicator and living organism as the interactor. By describing the interactor in industrial systems (such as firms), identifying replicators (such as behaviors, habits or business models), we could start to develop generative models of how socialtechnical systems comes to be. As firms, culture, technology, and market co-evolve, concepts like fitted-landscape, memes and temes could also be explored.
