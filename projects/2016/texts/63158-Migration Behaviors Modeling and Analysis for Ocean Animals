Summary
Given the movement track a migratory individual/population from location A (e.g. breeding season) to location B (e.g. non-breeding season), are they following the shortest path? If not, how random is their trajectory? And why are they bothering not using the shortest path?
Answering this would maybe require analysing the point data using various curve fitting methods and comparing to null models like a random walk for example.
