Summary
I have a dataset containing fanfictions in the top ~40 most popular fandoms from Archive of Our Own(archiveofourown.org/media). The data includes:

(1) Fanfiction texts (original and moderately preprocessed), within a time range between 2010-now (since AO3 was founded).

(2) ~ 25 metadata fields, some of which include: Kudos, comments, bookmarks, publish date, tags, rating, categories, etc.

(3) The texts represented as topic distribution by buiding LDA models (ongoing, will be completed soon).


My current work with it focus on studying the influence of readers' preference on the writings being produced. Meanwhile, I will be happy to share the data and looking for other ideas/questions that may be associated with it.
