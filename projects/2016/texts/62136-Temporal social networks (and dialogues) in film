Summary
I have two great datasets for analyzing social networks and interactions of characters in films (i.e., the social networks of the characters in the movies). 
One dataset has pre-processed dialogues from around 300 movies + metadata (this dataset is public; www.mpi-sws.org/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html). 
The other dataset has detailed information on the temporal scene structure (who appears on screen together etc.) for thousands of movies + metadata (e.g., rotten tomatoes scores); this data is more private/sensitive, but we can definitely use it for this project. 

Things I would like to do:

 How do structures of movie social networks predict genre, rating, box office success, country of production, etc.
 (Temporal) network motifs: what are the common patterns of different types of films? 
 Movie social networks vs. real life social networks.

 Andy Mellor (mmasm@leeds.ac.uk) - Very interesting project but perhaps a little to close to my PhD work. Definitely interested in the tempora network aspect/temporal motifs.
