Summary
IMDB has an open access dataset at: http://www.imdb.com/interfaces. Our project is based on the dataset and we have current several potential research questions:

1) The sleeping beauty of movies. Based on the "shoutouts" of one movie to another,  a "citation" network exists that connects millions of movies. The "sleeping beauties" had been identified in scientific paper citation networks, which are papers that became frequently cited a long time after publication. We are interested in finding similar (or different) patterns in the movie citation network.

2) If atypical combination of movie properties/citations/genres could predict its popularity.

3) A more general idea is the gender issue in movie industry, such as the different network structures of actor and actress.


We welcome any feedback!
