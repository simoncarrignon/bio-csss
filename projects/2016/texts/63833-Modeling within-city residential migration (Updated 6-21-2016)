Summary
Title: Measuring Within-City Residential Migration Flows and Exploring Attractors and Barriers to Mobility and its Consequences

Objectives:

 Measure within-city residential migration
 Characterize the mobility network
 Quantify flows of mobility across neighborhoods
 Explore attractors and barriers to residential mobility
 Quantify changes over time in the mobility network
 Explore the consequences of neighborhood mobility
 Impact of increased residential mobility throughput on neighborhood disorder.
 Predictive model of housing prices 

Study setting
City of Madrid (Spain), from 2004 to 2015 
Note: Madrid is divided into ~2400 census sections (~1500 people in each) nested into 128 neighborhoods (~20-30,000 people in each). 

Data sources:


Spanish Continuous Administrative Census (Padron)
Mobility data: in 1 year windows (from 2004-2014) how many people have moved from each census section to every other section, by age and level of education
Sociodemographic data: cross-sectional cuts every year (from 2005 to 2015), including data on education, age and country of origin, for all census sections
Other sources

Property value: from 2001 to 2015, by neighborhood; cross-sectional cut in 2016 with all houses under sale with their characteristics. 
Tax registry: geocoded housing units with data on year of construction and size (n~1.6 million housing units). Complete history from 2001 to 2016
Commercial spaces: geocoded list of all commercial spaces (and open/closed and licensed use)  from 2012 to 2016.
Traffic: every 15 minutes, from 2013 to 2016, all traffic lights
Traffic fines: date/time + geocoded address, type of fine (2014-2016)
Complaints: date/time + geocoded address, type of complaint (2013-2015)
Other: unemployment, labor data, election results, noise, pollution, gdp, vehicles..

Working Packages:

Management (overarching task)
Data cleaning and management, codebook management.
Code, data interfaces
Mobility as networks (1st stage):
Quantification of Mobility (flows)
attractors/barriers models
  Consequences of Mobility (2nd stage) 
  Measuring disorder 
  Predicting property value
