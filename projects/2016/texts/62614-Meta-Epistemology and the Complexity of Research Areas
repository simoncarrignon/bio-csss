Summary
There are a lot of reasons modeling techniques develop in different fields, some of which include: 1) certain techniques and methodologies are more suited for the phenomena being studied by the field, 2) there's often historical path dependence of modeling methodologies that may or may not be suitable for the phenomena being studied by the field, and 3) it's difficult to determine what kinds of instruments are suitable to the phenomena, so researchers may copy the methodologies of other fields. This project would be a general effort to categorize fields by the complexity of the phenomena being studied (obviously we will have to break many fields into subfields), determine whether the methodologies historically and currently being employed by the mainstream of the field are suitable for the level of complexity of the phenomena being studied, and look at the replication rate for mainstream findings on real data in the field to determine whether there is a relationship between the use of unsuitable methodologies and the lack of replicability.
