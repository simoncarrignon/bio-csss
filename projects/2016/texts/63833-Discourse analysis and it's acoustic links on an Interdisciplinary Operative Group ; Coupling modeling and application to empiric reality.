Method
This project consists on gathering and analyzing the data from an Operative Group centered around the task of disscusion onInterdisciplinary dialogue.

We will have 4 sessions with a group of 7 people and analyze the discourse and usual group dynamics with the model of the operative group (Pichon-Riviere) and psychoanalysis, but enlarging it with a non-linear dynamical systems perspective. Next we search for possible links that show up in an acoustic exploration from the wave patterns.

We can think the group functioning in this type of setting as a nondymical system, with agents interacting at first individually and "coldly", then mixing up as the system heats. In this model the energy is what pushes the language interaction and flow between the agents, and as the group dynamic takes hold and the energy increases, the interaction and ideas speed up and intensify. 

After the qualitative aspects of the data are analyzed (discourse and group dynamics analysis) we will pair it with a psychoacoustic analisis of the waveforms.

As we are actually creating the experiment and gathering the data that ensues, the links that show up between the quantitative and qualitative are yet to be discovered.

Nonetheless, following out first data analysis our general approach will be centered around finding the thematical nodes in the discourse and the edges they have, see if they are related to voice frequency sincrhonization between agents (for example, if they agree on the subject and add on it ad we find a link in sincrhonization) or if they are not synchronized ( which might happen if the agent is linked to the thematic node, but contradicting it in the content). Further connection on silence and outburst of laugther might give us indications of importance. Finally, another fruitfull analysis might prove to be an entropy factor (for example in a session with very low energy and less interaction between themathic nodes and agents, vs. one that's more dynamic, mixed, and fluid)

Summary for participants
How we conceive and relate to our models, its pros and cons and, what can we learn from our different fields? What steps are needed for implementing awesome mathematical models into human reality so societies can actually integrate them? Hence, what are some of the gaps and challenges that we often encounter in the transmission of scientific knowledge into political, social and cultural systems?
What is the model for consciousness in your Complex Systems Field? Is it rational agents? Self emerging systems? Politics and health systems? Relation of bees and flowers? Human interactions in networks? Frankenstein supercomputers taking over the world? Sentient structures? Maybe no conscience at all! With this interdisciplinary soup we can see what emerges in our interactions.

You can think of it as a little oasis of reflection in the midst of the project frenzy…with a side project! So it’s taking a breath to reflect on what we are actually doing. And moreover, what does the application of our models imply? If what we do is useful, what use could that be, and how can we efficiently communicate that to people outside our fields (very often in the decision making processes or the receiving end).
In that sense, it is more like a workshop, with the final point integrating some of our exchanges. If the qualitative aspects for this interaction are non-predictable, we can hopefully arrive to some general conclusions and acquiring some meaningful insight in our fields...or bring up some interesting new questions!

So no brain frying needed into the wee hours of the night, it’s just taking some (restricted) time in 4 sessions to reflect on what our work implies in an interdisciplinary environment in an open and convivial setting.

Concretely, what you need to do is: Show up in time to the 4 sessions and exchange in dialogue. We present our models and how do we relate to them, why do we think they are important or working, or lacking, and then see if we can learn something from other models and transdisciplinary applications.

There will be a second phase to analyze the information gathered. It’s not mandatory to participate (for example due to time constraints from your main projects) but the people willing to do it can chip in with their skills to find a way to apply some of our models to our own process (in a way, like a fractal intake of our own medicine) and see what we can get out of this experience. For example, beyond the analysis on group dynamics, ideas and concepts sprouting, can we spot patterns from the waveform of the audio recorded from the sessions? Are there peaks correlated to certain ideas or sensible points? Would a time series analysis of this give out something of interest? As the group is established, do we see a form showing up, some bifurcation or change of state that is different form the end in regards to the beginning?
