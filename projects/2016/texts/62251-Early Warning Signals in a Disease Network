Summary
In 2011 a major avian influence outbreak occurred in the domestic ostrich industry in the western cape of South Africa. This outbreak resulted in massive losses to the industry, and the eradiation of a significant number of farms. I have published papers looking at how the movement of birds may have caused the network to become more vulnerable over time (http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0086973), and also looked at how the system self organized following the crash (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/1365-2664.12486/asset/jpe12486.pdf?v=1&t=ipgcjacz&s=b6f493d011a1e9cafa5849eadd8cb8d59be7b055). 

I would like to investigate whether there were early warning signals of a regime shift. This work could relate to anticipating critical transitions, and looking to see whether this could present an empirical example of the presence of early warning signals. 

I currently have data from 2005-2014 but could easily obtain data until 2016. I am really open to ideas of how to work with this data.
