Summary
Have you ever: 
-	Been bored by listening to a monotone lecturer?  
-	Been inspired by a dynamic motivational speaker?  
-	Counted the number of “umms” in a conference talk? 
-	Thought about how lovely it is to listen to Morgan Freeman? 

And more importantly, are you curious about what properties in speech patterns elicit these reactions? 

There are many properties in speech time series (fluctuations in tone, pattern of sound/silence, word pattern, etc. etc.).  I’m interested in investigating patterns in these different properties, specifically how various complexity measures of speech relate to listener perception.  

Possible data:  online lectures, political candidate debates or speeches (could be fun, especially given current politics)
Possible measures of perception: “likes” or internet popularity, or a short study having CSSS participants rate short audio clips of people talking. 

could also play around with speech simulations 

Other ideas welcome!
