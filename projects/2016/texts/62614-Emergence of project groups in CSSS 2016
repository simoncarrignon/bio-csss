Summary
We want to model team emergence in cross-disciplinary academic research.  

- Is diversity important? 
- What makes teams productive? What makes teams fun?
- How do teams form information networks?
- How do members satisfice?
- How do members select their teams and how does that align with success of the group?
- What are the conditions for maverick rigor?

Merged from another project on same topic
field study of group formation in Summer Schools
we can use data on sex, nationality, profession and bio sketches
data on previous summer schools could be available as well

There is a nice paper about collective intelligence http://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6004/686 
which can also be useful

We checked with Juniper and she can provice data for sex,nationality, science interest, but probably only going back to 2011
