Summary
Some of you may be aware of the (important) things that are going on in the world today: the NBA finals, Euro 2016, the 100th Copa America, the NHL finals, et al. A question that I am interested in is trying to deduce what the probability was that the winner of the tournament was going to win based on the data generated by the tournament (the results of all of the matches).

My ansatz is that this will involve some Bayesian analysis to create models of the various teams, then a Monte Carlo phase of simulating tournaments based on these models. Once this MC dataset is created, one can ask any number of fascinating questions (e.g., What is the predictive power of the tournament? How sensitive is it to the seeding? What is a better tournament algorithm? And, of course, how unlikely is it for the US to win a major soccer tournament?)

I feel like I need to work some more [complexity] into this idea. Suggestions are welcome. Perhaps there is something to be said regarding the information generated by sporting events (as they are not simply random events as insinuated above).

Note: This is not just about sports, but these tournaments provide a timely example of data that is akin to the human subject data that I often encounter in my work (so don't feel bad about joining in if sports aren't your thing).

 Ellen Badgley - Not joining but I would suggest looking at the DOTA 2 data/description linked below, as this is an incredibly competitive e-sport and we have tons of tournament data for it.
Meeting Information
I think it would be incredibly appropriate to meet for the first time at a bar on Thursday evening: America is playing Ecuador and Cleveland managed to drag those bums back to Cleveland to get beaten by Cleveland in Cleveland.
