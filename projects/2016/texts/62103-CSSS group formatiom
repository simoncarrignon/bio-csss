Summary
Many of us had idea to make a field study of group formation in Summer Schools
we can use data on sex, nationality, profession and bio sketches
data on previous summer schools could be available as well

You can fill up the space with your ideas 

There is a nice paper about collective intelligence http://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6004/686
