Summary
There is an amazing GIS dataset from a group in Japan about material stocks in buildings and infrastructure -- cell size is 1km, it extends throughout the country over multiple years: 

Tanikawa et al. 2015: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.12284/abstract

Looking at the map of the stocked materials, there are clear links to complexity (fractals, scaling, etc.). I have a copy of the dataset (but limited ArcGIS skills). It would be awesome to form a team to dive into this dataset using complexity tools. I think interesting things can be learned related to physical infrastructure growth and the mass of cities.
