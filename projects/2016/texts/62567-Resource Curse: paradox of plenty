Summary
Economist have noted that an abundance of natural resources (usually non-renewables) is apparently linked to worse economic indicators, an absence of democracy, and a number of other negative effects regarding the general health of the nation or region. A few of us have discussed exploring the dynamics of this alleged curse using the tools of complexity science. One possible question to explore is does the resource curse exhibit self-similarity at smaller scales of time, resource quantity, and competitors for the resource? Anecdotally one could think of this as the difference between say a mineral rich African nation and a Walmart store on Black Friday. Both have finite resources and competitors attempting to reap the resource while it exists. And both have been known to invoke violent responses. 

We are open to exploring any other ideas related to the resource curse.
