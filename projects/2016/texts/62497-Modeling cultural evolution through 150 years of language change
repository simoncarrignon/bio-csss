Summary
I have a clean dataset of word evolution for 3 languages (English, French, German); this data is built from historical text (books mostly) and includes data for all words that are reasonably frequent/popular in that decade (more than 10000 words per decade). For every decade from 1850-2000 I have:

 word frequency/popularity
 historical "word vectors" (capture word meaning/semantics)
 word sentiment scores (whether a word is has a positive or negative connotation; English only)
 word part of speech tags (e.g., is a word used more as a noun or a verb in a given year). 
I also know of a bunch of other datasets on language change etc. that might be useful, depending on the groups interest. 

I am totally willing to give all this data away freely (even if I am not actively involved in the project). 
The project website with my data is: nlp.stanford.edu/projects/histwords/ 

Also, this is closely related to my thesis, so I would be relatively hands off, but I know of lots of data, references, etc. that can get everyone going. 
I work on more of the observational/data-driven side of things, though, and it sounds like there is a lot of interest in building more of a cognitive and/or ABM model that explains/predicts the patterns we see in real data (ambitious goal). 
I think that is an awesome idea!

Matteo Morini I've always wanted to work on evolutionary linguistics. You have the (coolest) dataset; now we need to devise a model. Perhaps an ABM (w/geographical, metaphorical, network-based space) where people settle, meet, migrate, adjust to new words/morphemes. The (ambitious) goal would be to trim the model as to mimic the empirical data. Sounds feasible? Btw, we will need to figure out (a.k.a. fake ^_^) a way to deal with spatializing the non-geographically referenced dataset. Who's in?
Juste Raimbault @Matteo would be totally interested in tackling this question of generating synthetic data (hybrid data) of spatial distribution for populations at given time periods (but already involved in two projects, so maybe ok if it is not intricated into the ABM and just the parametrization step)Â ; have at least historical data for French cities 1830-2000.


Anjali Tarun (anjalibtarun@gmail.com) I've encountered this paper (http://science.sciencemag.org/content/331/6014/176.long) that quantitatively analyzes culture using millions of digitized books. It would be interesting to see how language affect and distinguish each one's culture. [Will: The data on my web page is actually based on an updated version of the data in that paper.]

Elise Jing (jingy@indiana.edu) I will be very interested in looking at the evolution of meaning of words as embedded in their contexts (e.g. using an word2vec model).
