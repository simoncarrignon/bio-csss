Summary
We would like to build a genetic inspired model to describe the mechanism of music evolution in history.  Basic idea is that different elements of characters in music is analogous to genes. Mutation creates new music character and language material, hence it is the source of musical diversity (genetic diversity). Migaration and cultural exchange propagate a music style to different community. Recombination allows different elements to form certain combinations. Natural selection, which is influenced by audiences' musical culture background, aesthetic values and market ecology. Selection chooses certain combination over others and when the number of differences reaches a critical point, it can be identified as a new style. 

All ideas and discussions are welcome!
