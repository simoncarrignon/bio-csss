Summary
In situations where a problem's solution is presented in an unrecognizable language, we are interested in the trade-offs between learning that language and finding a solution in your own language. We intend to study several forms of language and information; the project could take many possible directions of widely varied scope:

Linear algebra: is it "better" to diagonalize a matrix or to represent eigenvectors in a non-eigen basis?
Computational mechanics: is it easier to learn/synchronize to an existing (perhaps non-optimal) model or to develop your own e-machine?

(motivation) Indigenous lore: Is it better to learn about an ecological system by listening to the lore of a native population or by strictly adhering to western scientific methods?
