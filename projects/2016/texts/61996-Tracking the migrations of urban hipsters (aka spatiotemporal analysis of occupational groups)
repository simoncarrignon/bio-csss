Summary
This is linked to the "Viscosity of Labor" question on the MITRE Challenge Questions list - see the separate link lower down.
In brief: looking at labor categories from US Census collected data and observing how they shift across spatial/temporal dimensions.  Does this change with the scale of the urban area, and is there a link to income or do the labor distributions hold static?
