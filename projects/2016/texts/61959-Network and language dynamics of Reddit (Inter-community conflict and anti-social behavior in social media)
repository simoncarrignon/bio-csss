Summary
I have a cleaned dataset of all Reddit (www.reddit.com) comments from 2009 through 2014 (Reddit is a very popular social media forum with >30 million users; it is organized into thousands of user-moderated "subreddits", which are topically-focused communities).
The data includes all the text of the comments, usernames, the upvotes, and the thread structures (so networks can be constructed). 
There are many interesting questions that could be investigated with the data, and I would love to hear ideas! (The data is totally public, and I am willing to share even if I don't work on the project).

I would be really interested in at looking at the network and language properties associated with inter-community conflict and anti-social behavior, but my current thoughts are very high-level (any concrete modeling suggestions are greatly appreciated).
For example, I think it would be really interesting to measure the network and language dynamics of brigading/trolling (e.g., how do trolls behaviors differ between their "home" communities/subreddits and the communities/subreddits they are attacking?)

I have done a lot of pre-processing and preliminary analysis on a manageable and very clean subset of all 2014 comments for 1200 mid-to-large subreddits (about 50Gb).
My background is in natural language processing and network mining, and I have lots of preliminary analysis/machinery for measuring linguistic signals in the data.
