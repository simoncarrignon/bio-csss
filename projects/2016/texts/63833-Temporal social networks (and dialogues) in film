Movie Project

Summary
We have three cool datasets for analyzing social networks and interactions of characters in films (i.e., the "social" networks of the characters in the movies, based on who appears with and talks with who). 

 Dataset 1: pre-processed dialogues from around 300 movies + interesting IMBD metadata (this dataset is public; www.mpi-sws.org/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html). 
 Dataset 2: detailed information on the temporal scene structure (who is on screen when + scene breaks etc.) for thousands of movies + metadata (e.g., rotten tomatoes scores); this data is more private/sensitive and is currently somewhat messy, but we can definitely use it for this project. It should be easy to extract dynamic networks from which characters are on screen together. 
 Dataset 3: high-level static (i.e., non-temporal) network structures for character interactions in 700 movies (this dataset is public; www.moviegalaxies.com; not totally clear how the data was constructed).
The plan is to use this data to give some really interesting insights into the art of storytelling and motifs/archetypes that re-occur. 

Main questions (that we have data for):

 Can we predict genre, critic scores, etc. from the network interaction structures? 
 How is gender represented in the interaction structure? And how has this evolved over the last 40 years?

 Juste Raimbault (juste.raimbault@polytechnique.edu) [definitively in, but not as main project. Can propose analyses such as NLP on dialogues or spatial analysis if there is spatial metadata.]
 Andy Mellor (mmasm@leeds.ac.uk) - Very interesting project but perhaps a little to close to my PhD work. Definitely interested in the tempora network aspect/temporal motifs.
