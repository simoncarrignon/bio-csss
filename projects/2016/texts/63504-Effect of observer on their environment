Summary
I'm interested in looking at how an observer affects their environment or the system they are studying.  I've talked to a few people about this, but the idea may need more refinement to make a good project.

I've added a channel named observer_effects to the SFI CSSS 2016 slack group.

Other Ideas
If anyone has more specific ideas, please add them here.

JE: My perspective on this is through information theory: information transfer from self-past to self-future, conditioned on self-present. or something. This would require that information to be transferred through the environment. This perspective does not require the "self" to be an "observer" per se, but I expect they are intimately related.
