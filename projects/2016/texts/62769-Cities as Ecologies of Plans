Summary
The idea that the macro economy is an ecology of interacting plans has been gaining force among heterodox, complexity-aware economists. Similarly, cities are increasingly understood as not only having ecologies, but as ecological systems themselves. The project would be to create an agent-based model (likely in NetLogo) that bridges between the literature in economics and civil engineering, envisioning cities as ecologies of interacting plans.

Plans are created by individuals as a kind of dynamic chain of actions and strategies to attain some kind of goal. Goals can be anything: money, love, power, career, altruistic ends. Plans interact with the plans of others: if you want to move into a city, all other things being equal and assuming no vacancies, you need someone else to move out. In that sense, your plan to move in is coordinated with someone else's plans to move out. The plans and goals of people who move in/out of and live in cities directly affect the city as an ecological system. A suggested model: look at how a city's resources, spatial distribution, and other metrics are affected by the plans (dynamic strategies) and goals of its inhabitants. Is a lack of overall coordination (disharmony with the plans/goals of other inhabitants) with negative consequences for other inhabitants reflected in the ecological system of the city?
