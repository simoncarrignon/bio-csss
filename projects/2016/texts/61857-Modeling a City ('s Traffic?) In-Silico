Summary
I have a few datasets laying around that I cleaned for my thesis (and I’m not using for that purpose) and a few more that I obtained but never cleaned. All of them are data for the city of Madrid (Spain) on various geographical and time scales/resolutions, most of them related to social/environmental/demographic variables. 
The one I’m most interested in using (and I have not cleaned yet) is a dataset of traffic intensity in Madrid. This uses sensors placed in most traffic lights (~3600), and the dataset provides count of vehicles (and associated % capacity used) every 15 minutes, from 2013 to March 2016. Some of the data is messy (but they have a flag for unreliable data). This data is freely available at datos.madrid.es (look for “intensidad de trafico”). 
Not sure how to insert an image here, but here's a link to a plot created with 45 days of this data on a single intersection. You can guess when the Holy Week and Holy Thursday/Friday happened this year: here  
I somehow have the sense that using this data may be a cool experience, but I have not figured out yet what to do with it.  
I have cleaned data on sociodemographic/socioeconomic characteristics at the census section level (~1500 people), geocoded commercial spaces data and more stuff that we can add to this. This also includes historical data on all properties (including houses, commercial spaces, etc.)  

Contact me (or talk to me anytime!) if you are interested or want to discuss some ideas!
