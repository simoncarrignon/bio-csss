Summary
High-level questions: How do (social) power structures emerge in complex networks? How do hierarchies restrict/modify information flow through networks? How does structural power (e.g., due to network hierarchy) differ/relate to intrinsic power (e.g. some nodes/people have more "skill/worth" regardless of their network position).

One idea I have is looking at the interplay of these dynamics by simulating (social learning) games on networks; for example, games where agents have to share information to estimate the worth of external items (like stocks, prestige goods etc.).
Other ideas would involve analysis of how information flow is affected by hierarchy etc.

Ellen Badgley (flyingrat42@gmail.com) - as you said this overlaps with the prestige goods project, and I think we can do some interesting network models that address both! [Will: IndeedÂ :)]

Crosato Emanuele (crosato.emanuele@gmail.com) - I can use information theory to investigate directional dependencies, might be useful?
