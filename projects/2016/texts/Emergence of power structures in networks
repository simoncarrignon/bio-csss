Summary
Note: This is now a separate project from the prestige goods project.

High-level questions: How do (social) power structures emerge in complex networks? How do hierarchies restrict/modify information flow through networks? How does structural power (e.g., due to network hierarchy) differ/relate to intrinsic power (e.g. some nodes/people have more "skill/worth" regardless of their network position).

One idea I have is looking at the interplay of these dynamics by simulating (social learning) games on networks; for example, games where agents have to share information to estimate the worth of external items (like stocks, prestige goods etc.).
Other ideas would involve analysis of how information flow is affected by hierarchy etc.
 

At the first meeting we talked about how power is multi-faceted, and informed by multiple interaction or resource types.  I really liked the idea of taking a multi-layer approach, running games on multiple networks (that may also relate to each other) which both contribute to power structure/hierarchy.
