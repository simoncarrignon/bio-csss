Summary
A couple of ideas:

1) Kantner from the Santa Fe School of Advanced Studies had an interesting paper on what prompts people to invest meaning/value/status in prestige goods, backed up by some data on turquoise in archeological contexts in the Chacoan culture (http://www.jstor.org/stable/27820883).  It would be interesting to a) implement this as an agent-based model, and b) explore some additional dynamics.
2) How does a prestige economy respond when the prestige goods all come from outside and the supply dries up?  
An interesting case study (and what inspired the question) is the Late Yayoi-period Japanese islands (roughly 100-300 CE), a network of chiefdoms closely connected to the Korean peninsula (as a source of ore) and the Chinese mainland (as a "tributary state" of the Han Dynasty).  The chief status markers in Western Yayoi society were Chinese-produced bronze mirrors and swords -- so that when the Han Dynasty fell (220 CE) and the supplies of these "goodies" dried up, we see evidence in the archeological record of upheaval (including an attempt to make homegrown replicas of the prized items).  This may also have contributed to the subsequent formation of more complex chiefdoms.
It would be interesting to put together an exploratory model of this (don't have data, at least not for the Japan example).  
I know some folks at SFI have been working on the dynamics of prestige.
