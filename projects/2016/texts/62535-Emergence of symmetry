I'm super fascinated by the question of why there is so much symmetry in nature?  For example, in the biological system, what are the evolutionary models that can explain such high percentage of species which exhibit certain type of (approximate) morphological symmetry? What can we learn from this mechanism? 

Inspired by different examples in nature, we can try to invent network models that exhibit emergence of certain symmetry and structure formation. We can also  analysis the chaotic behavior and entropy flow in the model we invented, and might discover some new phenomena of emergence!

All ideas and discussions are welcome!
