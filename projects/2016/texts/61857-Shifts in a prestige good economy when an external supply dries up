Summary
The question is in the title: how does a prestige economy respond when it is dependent on externally-produced goods that are suddenly no longer available?  
An interesting case study (and what inspired the question) is the Late Yayoi-period Japanese islands (roughly 100-300 CE), a network of chiefdoms closely connected to the Korean peninsula (as a source of ore) and the Chinese mainland (as a "tributary state" of the Han Dynasty).  The chief status markers in Western Yayoi society were Chinese-produced bronze mirrors and swords -- so that when the Han Dynasty fell (220 CE) and the supplies of these "goodies" dried up, we see evidence in the archeological record of upheaval (including an attempt to make homegrown replicas of the prized items).  This may also have contributed to the subsequent formation of more complex chiefdoms.
It would be interesting to put together an exploratory model of this (don't have data, at least not for the Japan example).  I know some folks at SFI have been working on the dynamics of prestige.
