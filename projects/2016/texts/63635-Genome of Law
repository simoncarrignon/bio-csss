Summary
Off-the-cuff discussion about how a given set of laws/statutes/legal regulations might have similarities to genetic regulatory networks. More of an exploratory look, but might have some compelling things to be found. James has study from a colleague at MITRE looking at networks of laws and how they reference each other, and there are similar toe-dipping studies, but nothing rigorous.
