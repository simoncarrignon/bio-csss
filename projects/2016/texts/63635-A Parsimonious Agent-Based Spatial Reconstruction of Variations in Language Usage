Summary
The project was born as a data-driven attempt at providing a sufficient and parsimonious explanation for observed stylized facts in the temporal evolution of language. 
We have unspatialized (non-georeferenced) data. A few well-known drivers pushing language(s) evolution exist. 
The idea is to develop an agent-based model where individuals, grouped in sub-populations, roam around, either offering and adopting “variations”. Do mutation also occur? How?
The population is constituted by groups/communities of heterogeneous agents (possibly, both at the micro- and the meso-scale) whose initial characteristics are bootstrapped with our data. An individual is more likely to be similar to individual belonging to the same community.
The model(s) will be trimmed in order to give a realistic temporal evolution, matching as closely as possible the real data.
In particular, we look for alternative spatial configurations leading to a close match vs. a bad match, offering a tentative causal explanation for the stylized facts observed in the data. Multiple models will compete in order to offer the best match.

Everybody is expected to step a bit out of their comfort zone (wrt data, modelling paradigms, …)
