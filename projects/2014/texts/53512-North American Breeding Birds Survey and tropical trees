This dataset contains ~4500 sites where populations of birds (~600 species overall, ~60 species on average in every site) were sampled over the past 44 years. This gives numerous time series of both population sizes and the overall number of species. Some problems with this dataset include large observational errors. A dataset of tropical trees with the exact diameter, identity (from among 300 species) and location of ~250000 trees over 6 censuses is also available. Please contact Michael Kalyuzhny for these.
