The Earth Microbiome Project EMP is a massively multidisciplinary effort to analyze microbial communities across the globe. The general premise is to characterize the Earth by environmental parameter space into different biomes and then explore these using samples currently available from researchers across the globe. All data sets are processed in the same way (DNA extraction, PCR primers, sequencing, bioinformatics), making them inter-comparable. You can explore these data sets (including some time series, and a bunch of spatial samplings) at the following link EMP Data (no need to create a login ID, just scroll down to 'Download Public Data'). If you have questions, please contact Sean Gibbons (sgibbons at uchicago dot edu).
