Field-based research, be it qualitative or quantitative, often yields fragmentary and limited data sets when collected in settings with political instability, economic disparity, and rapidly changing environmental conditions. Using the Logone river floodplain in Cameroon as a case study, this project aims to carry out multi-scalar analysis of fragmentary data sets to understand larger social dynamics and ecological regime shifts in this region. Our goal is to address the challenges of network analysis, agent-based modeling, and game theory in this context by examining multiple units of analysis at different scales.

Some of the possible issues to study are: common pool resources problems, influence of (corrupt) institutions, influence of the internal structure of these societies, etc. 

We will attempt to meet at 6:30pm today Thursday in the lecture room.
