Fields of Research are more often than not isolated from one another in terms of their community, jargon, perspective, research programme (in the sense of Lakatos) and their journals and lots more. 

This isolation stands in the way of a fruitful merging and interaction of fields. One needs to understand the obstructions. Hence an analysis of the determining factors for 'community inbreeding' is sought after. Eventually also a quantitative measure for the susceptibility of a research field could be formulated. 

A clear-cut project could be based on data together with a network type analysis of a precise question around the determining factors. 
We could look at citation data or journal based data or maybe there is a chance to get hold of data from Jessica's collegues, who works on the diffusion of knowledge. 

It would be great also to discuss and gather our ideas and experiences.
