You’re conscious right now, reading this. How does subjective experience emerge out of the bundles of particles that we all are?

Scholars of many fields have been deconstructing the mind/body dualism for a while, but consciousness remains a big, hard question. I’m no expert and by proposing this as a topic I’m not expecting that any of us will solve it, but I would be very interested in exchanging on the issue with the smart individuals that you are, grounded in so many backgrounds and unafraid of complex problems.

So... physicians and physicists, social scientists, biologists, mathematicians, philosophers, computer scientists and others… what do you think? Don’t hold back – if beer is necessary for you to address this issue, it can be arranged.
