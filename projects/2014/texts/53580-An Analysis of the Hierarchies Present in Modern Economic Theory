The idea of this project is to provide a comprehensive survey of the hierarchical structure of economics (macro -> microeconomics) following the reductionist = constructionist + emergence framework of Anderson. N.B. This equation is my own interpretation of Anderson's paper and is open for discussion. Ideally, we would fist investigate the microfoundations literature of macroeconomics and the possibility for ABM to rectify some of the redundancies therein after which we would reverse the direction and see how, given some 'fundamental' laws of economic behaviour, how we could couple these with emergent phenomena (whatever they may be) to reconstruct the economy at the macro-level.
