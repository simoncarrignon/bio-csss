We want to develop a concept of how to work with networks of qualitatively different types of relationships or interactions that can influence each other (eg. natural and social). Sign up and come to brainstorm with usÂ :) Contact: sanjakojasanja@gmail.com

For example, people's beliefs about the health benefits/risks of vaccination can be influenced by their social network, and may be studied using belief propagation models. Simultaneously, diseases may spread through a population, which can be studied using diffusion or other epidemiological models. Furthermore, people's beliefs about vaccination may affect their probability of getting infected by a disease, and in turn, getting infected may cause them to re-evaluate their beliefs.

Another example could involve an ecological network expressing predation and competition among species coupled with an environmental network.
