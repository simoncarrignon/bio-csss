 Emergence of consciousness  
You’re conscious right now, reading this. How does subjective experience emerge out of the bundles of particles that we all are?

Scholars of many fields have been deconstructing the mind/body dualism for a while, but consciousness remains a big, hard question. I’m no expert and by proposing this as a topic I’m not expecting that any of us will solve it, but I would be very interested in exchanging on the issue with the smart individuals that you are, grounded in so many backgrounds and unafraid of complex problems.

So... physicians and physicists, social scientists, biologists, mathematicians, philosophers, computer scientists and others… what do you think? Don’t hold back – if beer is necessary for you to address this issue, it can be arranged.

Note: this doesn’t have to become a formal project, although it could. Let me know if you’re interested in a chat, writing an interdisciplinary dialogue piece, or anything related to this question.

An after hour catch-up on Friday evening or this week-end? Here's a basic doodle poll to work out times: http://doodle.com/yi5wp3brbd2z8u5n
There is a published paper written by a MIT researcher "Consciousness as a State of Matter", just in case if you do not know this... Ernest
Thanks Ernest! I have a copy of this paper, which I will email through. Alireza put this page together for us to keep exchanging: http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/events/workshops/index.php/Emergence_of_Consciousness_Page
As far as meeting, most people can meet tonight except Ana-Maria and myself (going to the opening of this arts festival: http://currentsnewmedia.org ).. otherwise it looks like sunday over lunch (in the cafeteria) is the go. It's so many of us, there will no doubt be many partial meetings, so let's keep updating Alireza's page! Yesterday Emilia and I had a chat about this with Alfred Hubler about this, we will add ideas to the page later today. Cheers! Sarah
