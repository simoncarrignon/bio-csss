Do fluctuations in timeseries arise from nonlinear dynamics or from stochasticity? Specifically, there are several examples of ecological time series where chaos/complex periodicity were found (and published in Science and other leading journals). But usually such analyses didn't examine alternative models of stochastic dynamics. I propose making some meta-analysis and trying to compare the predictive power of both kinds of models. This can also be done in other fields were such timeseries are available. If you want to talk about this - contact Michael Kalyuzhny
