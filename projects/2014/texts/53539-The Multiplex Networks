How does the structure of social networks affect the emergence and persistence of norms? Why are some norms (like fashion styles) less persistent than others (like religious beliefs)? Is this because different kinds of norms live on different social networks (with same individual participating in different networks)? If yes, how do these social networks interact? 

And finally, what do the answers to the above questions tell us about policy interventions? Can certain critical properties of network structures be exploited to change norms, like going to the moon without much fuel? If two networks interact, say religious belief and fashion styles, can interventions in one be used to bring about changes in another?
