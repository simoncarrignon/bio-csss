The Black Queen Hypothesis BQH describes the evolution of functional dependencies in microbial ecosystems. This process results in a subset of a community providing necessary services for the rest of the community (see link). Organisms that can outsource essential functions escape the cost performing these functions and have more resources for growth and reproduction. However, this process makes the ecosystem more delicate, as the destruction of key species can eliminate their crucial service(s) and lead to system collapse. Thus, there is a tradeoff between the stability of a network (in the face of perturbations), and the degree of cooperation (how many tasks can be outsourced). As a result of this tradeoff, we could expect different community types to arise in stable vs. variable environments. There is likely some critical range between these two modes (high vs. low environmental variability), where some mixed strategy is optimal. 

This process may have an analogue in the development of multicellular life (vs. free-living single-celled organisms), where each cell type expresses a subset of the genome and provide a specific set of services to the whole (division of labor). This might also be reflected in social or economic networks (higher stability = more cooperative?). A connection could potentially be made to life-history tradeoffs for individual organisms (r vs. k selection - oligotrophs vs. copiotrophs), or in dissipative chemical systems (e.g. Stat-Mech of Self Replication).

Definitely a work in progress, please add your thoughts if you are interested!
