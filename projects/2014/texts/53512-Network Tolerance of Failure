How might a network endure non-catastrophic failure without isolating the failing components? Most network failure models consider resilience against failure as a result of isolating failing components. In contrast, is it possible for the network to be robust through "tolerance" of failure? Perhaps, for example, a symbiotic relationship sustains a weakened node until it has recovered its prior performance. Or perhaps a transmitting network retains a connection to an offline node to reduce an anticipated memory load of re-establishing the connection when it comes back online. What are some of the ways in which networks are able to maintain connection to a failing node without failing themselves in the process - how is the cascade halted without isolation? This is meant to be a broad question to generate more specific ideas. Importantly, this question refers to "tolerance of" failure in contrast to "resilience against" failure.
