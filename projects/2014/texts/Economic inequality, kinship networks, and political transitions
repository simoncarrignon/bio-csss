 Economic inequality, kinship networks, and political transitions project page 

Summary: 
It has been argued that political institutions are central to long-term economic development. Acemoglu and Robinson (2006) suggested that economic factors, namely the distribution of wealth, play a central role in political transitions (e.g. transition from non-democratic to democratic regimes). Building on Demetrius and Manke (2004), we would like to additionally consider the role of kinship networks in political transitions. That is, for a given state of the economy and distribution of wealth, what role do kinship networks play in facilitating or precluding institutional change? How might the outcome change with an altered distribution of wealth? As such, we implement a simple agent-based model to gain insight into the institutional outcomes of select historic events and, if possible, inform policy-making.
