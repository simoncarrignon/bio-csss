QUESTION: how single-cell evolves to multi-cell, even they do not have so-called “intelligence”?

How to do:
Let’s imagine that there is a land where resources A, B, C are located, and a kind of creature which need all of these resources to survive (imagine many creatures live in this land).
One surviving strategy is that every creature gathers A, B and C and eat them on its own. But maybe under some condition, specialization would automatically happen (e.g. one creature gather A and another gather B, and then they share).
The goal is to find the necessary condition if possible (we could think out of many sufficient conditions, but finding necessary conditions seems not so easy).
