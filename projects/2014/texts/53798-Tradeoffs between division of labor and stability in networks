The Black Queen Hypothesis BQH describes the evolution of functional dependencies in microbial ecosystems. This process results in a subset of a community providing necessary services for the rest of the community (see link). Organisms that can outsource essential functions escape the cost performing these functions and have more resources for growth and reproduction. However, this process makes the ecosystem more delicate, as the destruction of key species can eliminate their crucial service(s) and lead to system collapse. Thus, there is a tradeoff between the stability of a network (in the face of perturbations), and the degree of cooperation (how many tasks can be outsourced). As a result of this tradeoff, we could expect different community types to arise in stable vs. variable environments. There is likely some critical range between these two modes (high vs. low environmental variability), where some mixed strategy is optimal. 

This process may have an analogue in the development of multicellular life (vs. free-living single-celled organisms), where each cell type expresses a subset of the genome and provide a specific set of services to the whole (division of labor). This might also be reflected in social or economic networks (higher stability = more cooperative?). A connection could potentially be made to life-history tradeoffs for individual organisms (r vs. k selection - oligotrophs vs. copiotrophs), or in dissipative chemical systems (e.g. Stat-Mech of Self Replication).

Definitely a work in progress, please add your thoughts if you are interested! Also, please include your contact info alongside your name. 

MEETING TIME: June 12 @ 4:15PM - outside lecture hall 

Thoughts:
Vipin: I believe that this mechanism may have much to do with why "business cycle" occur.

Luis: Maybe this could be also related with the structure and complexity of institutions and its stability. Successful societies increase their size and develop more complex institutions (with higher level of bureaucracy for example) and that can make them less "flexible" and susceptible to get destroyed under not predicted crisis. I think this is related with "social entropy"...  

Ali: This paper might be of interest: http://people.biology.ufl.edu/ulan/pubs/Zorach.pdf They use Shannon's entropy to calculate "number of roles" or division of labor in a network. It is related to trade-off of division of labor and robustness.
