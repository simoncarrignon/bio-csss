The Black Queen Hypothesis BQH describes the evolution of functional dependencies in microbial ecosystems. This process results in a subset of a community providing necessary services for the rest of the community (see link). Organisms that can outsource essential functions escape the cost performing these functions and have more resources for growth and reproduction. However, this process makes the ecosystem more delicate, as the destruction of key species can eliminate their crucial service(s) and collapse the system. Thus, division of labor, which can result in higher functional efficiency (needs to be defined), comes at a cost.  There is a tradeoff between the stability of a network in the face of perturbations, and the number of tasks outsourced to a subset of the community. As a result of this tradeoff, we might expect different community types to arise in stable vs. variable environments. There is likely some critical range between these two modes (high vs. low environmental variability), where some mixed strategy is optimal. 

This process may have an analogue in the development of multicellular life (vs. free-living single-celled organisms), where each cell type expresses a subset of the genome and provide a specific set of services to the whole (division of labor). This might also be reflected in social or economic networks (higher stability = more cooperative?). A connection could potentially be made to life-history tradeoffs for individual organisms (r vs. k selection), or in dissipative chemical systems (e.g. Stat-Mech of Self Replication).

Definitely a work in progress, please add your thoughts if you are interested!
