There is a significant set of natural and biological network data that has been investigated. How can insights, lessons and parallels be applied to modern organisations, modern networks and modern contexts? Can innovation, idea diffusion and increased resilience be informed by key insights? 

This group has met twice to form initial views and if there is enough interest (>3-4 people) will continue or if not may merge with other innovation and network related areas.
