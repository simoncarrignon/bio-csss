Are there characteristics of a network's nodes that make the network more or less robust to failure?  Perhaps degree assortativity, or nodes' positions relative to the demands made on them?  Given that network failure can affect every node in a network, nodes might, as it were, gain an advantage from being positioned far away from nodes that could catastrophically fail.
