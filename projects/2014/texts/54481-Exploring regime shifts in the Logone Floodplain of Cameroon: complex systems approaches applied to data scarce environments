Field-based research, be it qualitative or quantitative, often yields fragmentary and limited data sets when collected in settings with political instability, economic disparity, and rapidly changing environmental conditions. Using the Logone river floodplain in Cameroon as a case study, this project aims to carry out multi-scalar analysis of fragmentary data sets to understand larger social dynamics and ecological regime shifts in this region. We want to experiment with the benefits and limits of complex systems approaches and tools (starting with a common pool resources model) when applied to a complex case study.

Next meeting 2:45 Tuesday in lecture room (to start with).
