Do foraging animals and growing cities utilize resources in the same way?  We're interested in building an agent-based model which generates a road network on a map of varying resources by following a set of simple, probabilistic rules.  How do the properties of this network evolve through time?  How much of city growth can be explained by resource constraints?  Do simple rules of growth parallel simple rules of animal foraging behavior?  This project will explore agent-based modeling, but will also present opportunities to examine the limits of modeling.
