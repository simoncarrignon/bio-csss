The heart is a complex system with simple rules of operation and minimal central control. Under normal conditions, it orchestrates a self-organized, emergent behavior of 2 to 3 billion heart cells to perform sophisticated, well-timed pumping of the blood. Under abnormal conditions, it can lead to sudden cardiac death due to cardiac arrhythmias, which are also emergent, collective behaviors of a large number of heart cells, where each heart cell doesn't necessarily need to be abnormal.

Each heart cell is a dynamic information processing system, which transmits digital information (0 – resting, 1 – excited) in the form of electrical wave. We aim to establish a theoretical basis to quantify information transmission within the heart using information theory and network theory. Our hypothesis is that arrhythmias following heart attack result from an adaptive mechanism to optimize information transmission in abnormal hearts.
