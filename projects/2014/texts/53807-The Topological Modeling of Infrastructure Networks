There is some disagreement on the topology of power networks in the literature. There are preferential attachment, small-world and random graph models proposed to explain the topology of power networks. There are caveats associated with each of these generative models. For instance, there is the cost of building new transmission lines that may question the validity of preferential models. 

The broad question that we attempt to answer here is:

-Can these previous network models create real-world power networks?
-Can we come up with a better model that can replicate a power network or at least one with similar characteristics?
-What about other infrastructure networks, e.g., natural gas network, water piping networks, etc?
