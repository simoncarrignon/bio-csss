The interest of this project is the following: how can evolutionary game theory be used to find optimal strategies for consumers and/or producers that bid in the electricity market. Also some real data can be considered.

The project is currently not active. Due to the fact that I am just starting this research, I still don't have a project-appropriate well-defined idea on which we could work on. Still, it might happen that we can start the project towards the end of the school and then continue to  work on it after the school is ended. Thank you all so much for your interest in the project. I wish you best luck with your other projects.
