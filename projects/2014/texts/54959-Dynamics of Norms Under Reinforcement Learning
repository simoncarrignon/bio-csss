 Dynamics of Reinforced Norms

Summary: 
We investigate how societal/cultural norms are reinforced and how they affect decision making of an agent. Agent decision is conditioned by an identity saliency vector. Each identity of the agent connects it to a number of other agents that reinforce the choice of the agent. For instance, the role of agent as a daughter connects it to her family which may support decision to invest in education or not. We study how the the connection of agent with other agent may affect the saliency vector and cause the agent to change the decision rule.

Why do we study this? 
The application of this project is to inform policy making and designing the right intervention points (pressure points) that one can use to change norms in a society.
