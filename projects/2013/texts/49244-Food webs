It seems like there is A LOT of interest in food webs amongst this group.  Since there are so many people, maybe it would be worth coming together and dividing into smaller groups based on the questions (there are many!) people are interested in addressing and skills. I think it would good be to have some coordinated effort, for efficiency and productivity. We could divide questions, or parts of bigger questions, or approach the same questions, using different methods and then compare results and try to understand the similarities and differences.  Maybe we could meet at 3 pm today (Wed) or at dinner.
