 Pablo and  I started to discuss a project where we could use cross-impact balances (CIB) to investigate the implications of alternative hypotheses for interrelationships between various socio-economic/political factors. We began discussing this from the perspective of testing competing political economic theories to see what types of institutions (e.g. styles and stability of governance) would be self-consistent according to the theories. However, I would be open to other topics, including research questions inspired by GDELT. If there is interest to learn more about the CIB technique, I could put together a tutorial.  --Vanessa

A  tutorial on cross-impact balances and Markov chains is scheduled for Wed. June 5 at ~4:15. Everyone is welcome, even if your project interests lie elsewhere. ==
