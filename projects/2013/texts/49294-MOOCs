I have had an interest in MOOCs and their potential role in the future of education/ as a means of providing education to non-traditional students.  This has been in the back of my mind for some time, but I have no experience dealing with real social data (including how to access it) and was hoping other people might be interested.  I did a brief search and found that it may be possible to use twitter data.  The questions I am interested in are where MOOCs are popular (globally), how it spread, what kind of topics, etc.  Anyone else interested?

An automated cluster analysis of the content of Coursera catalogs would be quite straightforward. It could help get a sense of meaningful clusters of content regarding how courses present themselves, and also what categories are salient for MOOC's.   --Manish
