Max Kleiman-Weiner and I have a corpus of all the Shakespeare plays and have been talking (with many of you, too!) about building a system to automatically classify Shakespeare plays as either comedy or tragedy. A simple approach would be to just use a bag of words to see if the plays can be classified based on lexical content alone. We have also been discussing building social networks for each play based on which characters interact (i.e., who speaks before and after whom). We suspect that the social network structure of a comedy and tragedy should look different from each other. Do characters in comedies have more connections? Do tragedies and comedies start off the same and then have networks that evolve differently over the course of the play? Or are they different from Act I? This may be an opportunity to look at how social networks change over time in a specific domain. We could also look at the different roles of men and women in the social networks of the plays.
