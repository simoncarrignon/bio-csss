 I  was thinking about how some, but not all, species of fireflies can synchronize their flashes, as was mentioned in both lectures today (June 4).  The mechanism is fairly simple, it seems, so we should be able to evolve it using a simple genetic algorithm, right?  This is only half-baked at the moment, and I haven't checked to see if it has been done already, but I thought it would be neat to explore the space around these biological phenomena.  More of a fun project than a serious "lets publish this!" type of project.  Bonus points if we can work some neural network stuff into it.

Still using genetic algorithms, under what conditions can we evolve a stable polymorphic trait in a population, and under what conditions does a monomorphic trait evolve?  This is applicable for traits in a population, but we would like to use the same model to evolve (for example) multiple or novel sensory modalities in a species, number of members in a food web, predation strategies, etc.  Interested?  Find us at lunch!
