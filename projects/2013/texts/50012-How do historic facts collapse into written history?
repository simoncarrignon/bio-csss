Let's begin with a nice example: Gilgamesh, the fifth king of Uruk, decided to gather together some stories that local tribes and surrounding cultures had been telling for years, along with things that previous kings had done. This became the Epic of Gilgamesh. Someone later does a cover of the original book with some new contributions and turns it into what nowadays is the bible and the torah. Another remake of the tale turns these books into the quran, and until today... you know the rest of the story already. Peer reviewed quality, just like Nature or PNAS. 

It might be interesting to study how history goes from facts to a written, definitive form which is not (and maybe cannot be) completely faithfully to the actual events. There is huge room to use, for example, models of agents that contribute to form a History with pieces of information that sums up, sometimes with contradicting versions, sometimes with hidden interests, etc etc. Furthermore, we have a great tool in the wikipedia!! We can track, for example, how many changes are made on different entries over time. We can check whether there are some generalities, how the number of edits depends on the time gone after the historic event, maybe we can quantify how successive stories differ from each other and whether there are turning points that dramatically change the whole thing... 

So this is the general framework. I think this is a very exciting topic and I'd be glad to talk about this with anyone!! Just contact me! --  Luíño
