My idea is to start a brainstorming, it is nothing more than some disjoints thoughts!!! And many questions without an answer so far!! :-)

I would like to investigate how biological systems obtain their energy requirements. Are there patterns or network structure that evolution has developed and that are efficient for animals/plants?
Can we replicate these structures/networks/patterns in the way we (humans) obtain our energy? Can we learn something from the evolution of the energy provisioning of other species? Is that feasible?
My primary idea (given my research bias) is to then apply the findings to the structure of the electrical system. Is the current centralized generation and long distance distribution something that appears in nature? Is there a more efficient way that emerged from evolution in biological context that we can use for future provisioning?

We can apply this not only to electrical systems but more in general to the way we use our resources.


Anyone interested with ideas, feedbacks, thoughts? –  Andrea

Ecological networks are, indeed, finely structured both topologically and energetically. I'd very much like to talk to you about this idea in more detail. -- Ashkaan

Definitely interested & would love to talk more. –  Kristen Honey
