This project would model caribou management dynamics in a prototype NW Alaska community during a caribou shortage. Agents in the model would be informed by data from household subsistence surveys and from management history. The goal would be to evaluate the abilities of different management strategies to achieve biological harvest goals while maximizing economic efficiencies in the community. This is a real-world problem with near-term applications. Caribou cycle on 30-to-50 year periods. The Western Arctic Caribou Herd is currently in decline. During the last caribou “crash” in this region, the state management system attempted to reorganize caribou production, which generated considerable political and social disruption, precipitated widespread passive resistance among Native peoples, and left a legacy of contempt for both management (among some Inuit) and for Inuit hunters (among some sport users). The hope is to reduce conflicts during the expected nadir of the population. Comments and cooperators welcome!  Jim

Neat topic with data, I assume! I'm interested & would love to talk more. –  Kristen Honey
