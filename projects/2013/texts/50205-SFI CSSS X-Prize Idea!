Every summer, PhDs & post-docs descend on SFI and learn by doing through amazing projects, so here's an idea -- maybe more of a challenge -- for future SFI students, faculty & staff (the idea would require some additional SFI fundraising by faculty & staff). What if SFI set up a project competition with a reward, like an X-Prize, for some healthy competition & real reward? The winning group could receive a monetary prize -- perhaps funds to cover conference attendance & travel, for example to present 2013 SFI CSSS work at the Complex Systems Society in Barcelona, Spain: http://www.complexssociety.eu/

SFI X-Prize could be fun! -  â€“  Kristen Honey
