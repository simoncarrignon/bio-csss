New media accounts are talking about the scale of the US National Security Agency's surveillance program (Hey, NSA folks!). It looks like they're running some network analysis  with >70 trillion (not a typo) edges. We've got a good group of network people here. Anyone want to do something topical and try to put together a discussion / estimation of what can and can't be done with data that big? -- David

Any website with info about this? Someone interested to meet over this topic? --  Luíño

Interesting topic, let me know when/if you wanna discuss about it --  Andrea
