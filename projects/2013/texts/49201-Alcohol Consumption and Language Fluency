(This is just one of my random thoughts, don't take it too seriously. I'm bringing it up in case it would actually add interesting noises to anyone's thought process) 
There's a interesting thing about me and some of my friends who speak a foreign language. There seems to be a kind of non-linear curve that depicts my blood alcohol concentration and the fluency of my speaking English (Chinese is my native language). For example, usually after one beer, I start to talk faster, and semantically relevant words pop up in my mind more fluently or spontaneously. Or say, I express the same idea with less stuttering and in shorter time. But after some point, i.e. 32 oz of beer, even it might still sound fluent, regarding the physical property of the speech, the grammatical structure of the sentences start to break down. Ultimately, i.e. half bottle of rum, I only repeat 2-3 very short sentences/phrases independent of the presence or the identity of my audience(s) (i.e. murmuring in English for hours to a group of Chinese friends). 
We know that alcohol can influence our behavior by, among other things, binding to certain neural receptors (like GABAa?). I just thought it might be interesting to model how alcohol intake influences the dynamics of language production via regulating neuron signaling. I'm also wondering about what it might imply about our brain dynamics when we're silent. 
Welcome to talk to me if you find this interesting, or silly, or you simply want to correct my grammar. Thanks!

@Mengsen I'd be very interested in doing some empirical work on this topic.

I've experienced this same thing with Spanish, Bahasa Indonesia, and playing billiards/pool. Creative topic with solid scientific underpinnings that lend themselves nicely to complex systems modeling, I suspect! â€“  Kristen Honey
