The human body is its own ecosystem -- much like the ocean -- with resilience, hysteresis, synergistic properties, and multi-system dynamics that depend on matrix conditions. Can we use our understanding of the ocean and ecosystems to help us heal? Can we model different scales -- an ocean, a human body, and a microbial community -- to explore ecosystem/human/microbial health in a holistic context that depends on shared key elements like flow & trace minerals as building blocks for function? As one example to think about, chronic illnesses like HIV/AIDS or Lyme disease disrupt the immune system and human body functions (e.g., methylation pathways, detox pathways), preventing optimal function that weakens the human body and makes it vulnerable to other infections. It’s a downward spiral of negative feedbacks, analogous to a backed-up, atrophying ocean or estuary that causes fish kills, destroys coral reefs, etc...  analogous to microbial communities that shift when environmental/matrix condition change. I suspect our knowledge of the ocean & large ecosystems, which we can see and visualize, can inform new thinking about system dynamics for health & recovery at the scale of a human body and at the scale of individual microbes & microbial communities...

Anyone else interested? –  Kristen Honey

- This sounds like a really nice idea. It would be interesting to understand how the disease-mediated degradation of immune/metabolic networks (the loss or alteration of edges and nodes?) affects the response of these networks to further perturbations (e.g. asymptotic stability and resilience, transient reactivity, cascading effects of node loss, etc.). I have little knowledge of the medical literature, but I am experienced in ecological network analysis including information theoretic analyses of weighted food webs. --  Ashkaan


- I liked the idea very much. In fact I am looking at similar issues related to management of ecosystems which display hysteresis and regime shifts. Here is some pertinet information related to shallow lakes and its complex dynamics. Your idea of scaling down to human level is interesting --  Vishwa

- Sounds interesting. I have experience in microbial oceanography, but not so much with infectious disease. I'll be there for the dinner meeting. -  Jody Wright

FRIDAY 6/7 BEER & WINE BRAINSTORMING ACCOMPLISHED!: Let's convene tonight after SFI, 8:30ish or 9:00ish, Friday June 7th, downtown for some DOWN TIME! We've already put our brains together & focused project scope. Now it's beer & wine & fun in Santa Fe with everyone! :)
