In the current phase of globalization, networks in logistics, travel, finance, disease, energy, and ecology are growingly increasingly interconnected on a global scale. Hence, situations arise where mortgage defaults in the US bring down the Icelandic pension system, and a volcano in Iceland disrupts global air traffic. Given the scale of interconnectedness, can complexity science help develop a sense of how small perturbations in one global network might cascade into large unforeseen failures in another network? I'm wondering if we can help build a more generic grammar for describing interconnected networks and the risks posed by such systems. Would it be possible to mitigate risk at smaller local levels of scale, or do small corrections of local risk inevitably cascade into larger risks that we lack the ability to respond to (think wildfires in the Southwest where more frequent small fires would help reduce the chance of large scale fires that cannot be controlled.) I'd love to talk with anyone interested in ecology, globalization, risk, and network modelling.

My advisor at Princeton is already funded for a three year interdisciplinary symposium on Global Emergent Risk, so if people are interested, we have resources to carry on a larger research engagement.
