I'd like to throw out an idea I've had for a while: Most animals use space in very important ways -- predators encounter and consume prey in both 2D and 3D environments, birds and fish migrate across continents in search of resources and mates, and plant pollinators fly or walk from flower to flower, in turn providing an indispensable economic service to humans. The study of food webs attempts to understand how networks of species that eat each other persist in the face of (sometimes constant) external perturbations. Yet, network-level food web studies seldom address the dynamics of animal movement, and I see this as a fundamental shortcoming in our understanding of nature. Recently, scientists in fields like computer science, physics and neurobiology have begun to model and explore multi-level or multiplex networks -- networks of nested networks. This seems like an reasonable candidate for the theoretical study of multiple food webs that are linked by by spatial networks of animal movement. One preliminary question that comes to mind: How do the number of "mobile" species and the "speed of movement" alter important dynamical properties of complex food webs at larger spatial scales (i.e. at the meta-food web scale)? I am not dead set on answering this question, and I look forward to gaining insight from scientists who study other types of networks. I'm also not set on the multiplex network framework. Potential alternatives that come to mind are IBMs, PDEs on graphs or integrodifference equations. I look forward to any suggestions or bright ideas! -- Ashkaan
