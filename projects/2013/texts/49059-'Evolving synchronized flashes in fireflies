 I  was thinking about how some, but not all, species of fireflies can synchronize their flashes, as was mentioned in both lectures today (June 4).  The mechanism is fairly simple, it seems, so we should be able to evolve it using a simple genetic algorithm, right?  This is only half-baked at the moment, and I haven't checked to see if it has been done already, but I thought it would be neat to explore the space around these biological phenomena.  More of a fun project than a serious "lets publish this!" type of project.  Bonus points if we can work some neural network stuff into it. Bryn_Gaertner
