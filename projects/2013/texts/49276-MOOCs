I have had an interest in MOOCs and their potential role in the future of education/ as a means of providing education to non-traditional students.  This has been in the back of my mind for some time, but I have no experience dealing with real social data (including how to access it) and was hoping other people might be interested.  I did a brief search and found that it may be possible to use twitter data.  The questions I am interested in are where MOOCs are popular (globally), how it spread, what kind of topics, etc.  Anyone else interested?
