I would like to see a simple smartphone app that can track connections being made between people at events. This would allow to map the evolution of a network at eg a network meeting, SFI 2015, social events etc. I know some people at MIT have been working on ID badges for nurses and doctors to track interaction in a hospital, and there are some business apps that show a plethora of features to enjoy a network event (eg like the Yapp app). However, it would be nice to have a simple app that just registers a link between people when their phones are close enough for a certain interval of time. Additionally, it might record some conversation as to create edge information as well.
Unfortunately, I'm not a wizzkid and would need help from an apps programmer to work this out. If it is feasible, I think SFI CSSS 2015 would be a great test case!
