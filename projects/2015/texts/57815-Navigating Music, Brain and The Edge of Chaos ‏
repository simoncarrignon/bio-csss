Context

Brain Sciences have revealed that we/it lives "on the edge of chaos" exhibiting "self-organized criticality" that is tentatively balanced between normalcy and madness. Over the course of history, humans have used various agents and activities to shape, influence and control this living-chaos ranging from substances such as caffeine, sugar, drugs etc., to activities such as the arts (including music), social-discourse/therapy, meditation etc. Of these, music has a distinct role in shaping our moods and helping us transition between different mental states, as well as maintain it for extended periods of time. Clearly we have been using music to help us control and shape the internal chaos. But until recently, the quantitative instrumentation of this massively complex system that comprises of close to a 100-billion neurons networked into a 1000-trillion synaptic edifice has not been available to the common man. But of late, affordable, wearable EEG's are available on the market, thus making the quantitative study of the influence of music in brain dynamics feasible on a large-scale/crowd-sourcing sense. To help come to terms with the complexity of our 1000-trillion synaptic edifice, we need to gather data on a vast scale. The proposed research is a proof-of-concept, exploratory foray into making this happen.           


Data and Questions

The goals of this project include 


Evaluate and purchase a wearable EEG
Set up the instrumentation for data capture
Set up the experimentation/data-capture plan 
Recruit Subjects
Perform Data Capture
Analyze Results
Propose pathways to take this to the market by embedding it as an app


Possible methods

Four principles of bio-musicology, W. Tecumseh Fitch 2015
This paper is a prospectus for biomusical research. Main points: 
i) musical is complex (yes!)
ii) questions must be asked from a Tinbergean perspective (i.e. mechanism, ontogeny, phylogeny and function),
iii) comparative between animals (not relevant for us), and 
iiii) "ecologically motivated," i.e. not just Western skilled musicians.
