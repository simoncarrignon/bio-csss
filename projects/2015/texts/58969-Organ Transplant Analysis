Over 120,000 people in the United States are currently on the waiting list for an organ transplant.  The size of this waiting list relates to over 6,000 deaths a year while waiting for a transplant and tens of billions of dollars in government spending.  I have access to the following data sets:


 All transplants performed in the US from October 1987 to June 2014 (including follow-up data)
 All living and deceased organ donors in the same time period (with follow-up data on living donors)
 Waiting list data for everyone who signed up for the list
 2012 National Survey on Attitudes and Behaviors on Organ Donation
 Social media data relating to organ donation since 2008 
Open to ideas and suggestions for the topic, there are a lot of interesting questions to investigate including cultural/racial/gender differences in organ donation.  I have several preliminary reports and exploratory analysis done on differences in donors.

Second Meeting Thursday, June 11th 4:15 in the coffee shop!
