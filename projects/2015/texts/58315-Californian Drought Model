Problem definition: 
Water is an ongoing problem in California. Although corrective measures are taken for some years, periods of droughts are depleting water ground levels to not sustainable levels. 
Aims:
A Netlogo simulation on how likely Californian agents evolve with regards to drought. The ABM could be used to explore the potential impacts of forms of regulation. 
Outcomes:
Create an exploratory agent based model based on real data, enabling the possibility of simulating different methods of regulation, including feedbacks between the economic and hydrologic systems.

Extension 1: We will conduct a network analysis of Twitter data (hashtags #drought #California) to explore the social dynamics and information flows between stakeholders.

Extension 2: Phase-space reconstruction of groundwater level time series data, comparing the dynamics in different parts of the Central Valley.
