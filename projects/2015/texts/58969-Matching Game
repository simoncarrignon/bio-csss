Rules for the matching game:

Objective: Create the largest chain possible using blood types in the room.

Follow the blood type guidelines for donation to form a donor chain.  

Assume that self-matches are not possible, for example someone with a donor of type AB and a recipient of type AB can not match themselves and needs to find someone else to complete their chain.
Create a donor chain to help as many people as possible. 
Post results below for the prize
There will be several "good samaritan" donors which will donate and need nothing in return, this is a great way to start your chain.  Using a good samaritan chain also means you don't need a donor for the end point.
