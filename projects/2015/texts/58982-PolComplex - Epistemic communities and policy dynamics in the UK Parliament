Over the last twenty years, there has been extensive debate about what the core topics in public policy are, and if they change according to type and number.  Furthermore, it is still not clear how policy topics mutate and diffuse over time. Human-based text analysis of governmental documents has shed only some light on these research questions: 21 general topics have been proposed, while other accounts tend to restrict it to about five main clusters.  Yet, this approach has not been able to devise a reliable and systemic method to capture topic dynamics, diffusion, and their relation to the human actors that talk about them.

This project is an extension of an exploratory research that intends to overcome such limitations, through the application of natural language processing (more specifically, dynamic topic modeling and sentiment analysis), topological and network analysis on a dataset containing UK House of Commons debates ranging from 1975 to 2014. The aim is manyfold. We hope to identify the structure and dynamics of epistemic policy communities - i.e. of political actors revolving around similar policy interest -, and how these relate to factors such as party membership, seniority, relevant historical events.
