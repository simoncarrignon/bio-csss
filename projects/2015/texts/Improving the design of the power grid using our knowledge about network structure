Context
Given all the renewable energy generation that is being installed and the increasing levels of uncertainty about the future power system, power transmission expansion planning is becoming more and more challenging. There is a lot of literature being published in the field, but it always applies"blind" techniques to the design, such as optimization where the possible lines to add to the system are represented as binary variables. This leads to optimization problems that are too large for real networks. As part of the European Comission FP7 project e-Highway, my team and I have developed methods to reduce the complexity of the network and work with a smaller system.


I would like to explore a different avenue. Maybe it is possible to describe the structure of good network designs in terms of global parameters. For instance, how does the degree distribution look like for efficient power networks? Then, we could feed that information into the optimization problem, reducing the search space.


Data

I have data originating in a European project from the FP7 programme.


Relevance

There is lots of interest in this field, a lot being published, lots of money going into projects and many research grants. Nobody seems to be looking at it from a structure perspective though.


To know more...

I uploaded a ppt with some initial ideas to my page on the wiki.
