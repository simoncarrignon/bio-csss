Key words: resilience, natural hazards, supply chains, interdependency, interconnected risks, cascading failures

Rational: I am interested in examining what kinds of network structures and features contribute to increasing resilience of supply chains to natural disasters. I believe this area of work is important because regional disasters negatively impact the global economy through disruptions in supply chain networks. The pioneer study published in Nature urges the need for making supply chains climate-smart (Levermann 2014). Also in the industry, the World Economic Forum published a report to address this issue in 2013. Few researches, however, assess and model the impacts of adverse weather on supply chains. I would like to evaluate the impacts based on modeling.

Data set: Supply chains data of a multinational manufacturing company.Global climate data, disaster data, etc.

Possible techniques: Agent-Based Model, Complexity science, network theory and evolution, complex adaptive systems, GIS, operations research, manufacturing engineering, and I am open to any techniques.

Myself: As I joined the program yesterday, please find my background here.
