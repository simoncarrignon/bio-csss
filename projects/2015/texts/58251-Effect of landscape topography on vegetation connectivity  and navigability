Context

Landscape topography influences the dynamics of the processes that take place on it. Evolution of ecosystems networks, river networks, vegetation cover type, microclimate cycles are all interlinked deeply to the local landscape topography.

In addition to the landscape these networks are also influenced by each other conditioning the emergence and stability of ecosystems, and subsequently the behaviour of agents in the ecosystem like migration pathways of animal herds, human settlement patterns etc. 

Connectivity patterns emerge from the interaction of these processes, and thus a better understanding and quantification of those patterns is critical to understanding the dynamics of the system.  


How do we want to approach the problem

In this project, we will randomly generate landscape topography and subsequent vegetation cover from a set of parameters from known geological and biological processes. The generated data set will then be used to investigate the following questions:

(1) What is the connectivity of landscape patterns that emerge at different scales using different techniques such as clustering analysis, percolation theory or network theory, and can we quantify themÂ ?

(2) What is the navigability of biological agents (e.g animals, humans, robots!) under such landscape patterns. We can compare mobility trails in existing landscapes to validate our hypothesis. We propose to use the tools like ABMs to simulate and characterise mobility success.

(3) We further aim to compare the measures of navigability with the metrics of connectivity, establishing a framework of comparison.
