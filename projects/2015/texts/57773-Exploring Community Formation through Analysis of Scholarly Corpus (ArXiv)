The Arxiv [1] is a free online repository of scientific preprint articles, mostly from physics and mathematics.  It currently contains over 800,000 articles, dating back to 1991.  Currently, a lot of the data associated with this repository is completely available: paper submission dates; full texts of papers; author names and coauthorship information.  Additionally, there is some citations data available.  (If necessary, I can also find papers' subdiscipline 

Brainstorming notes
Isolation between topics, crossing interdisciplinary boundaries, finding (topological) separation distance between disciplines or research groups

Tipping points - can we look for separation of or mergers of two groups or disciplines?

Can we identify key papers (or groups of papers) that initiate ties between fields.

Sentiment analysis: can we identify when a paper's citation is an endorsement or a refutation?

Tools for Analysis: Change point detection; relational event models

Can we find more comprehensive/better citation data?

Lucene and indexing tools:
- Can we re-index our text database after removing stop words?
- Can we index the titles and abstracts?
- Elastic Search - tool for interacting with Lucene
