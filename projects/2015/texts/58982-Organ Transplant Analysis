Over 120,000 people in the United States are currently on the waiting list for an organ transplant.  The size of this waiting list relates to over 6,000 deaths a year while waiting for a transplant and tens of billions of dollars in government spending.  I have access to the following data sets:


 All transplants performed in the US from October 1987 to June 2014 (including follow-up data)
 All living and deceased organ donors in the same time period (with follow-up data on living donors)
 Waiting list data for everyone who signed up for the list
 2012 National Survey on Attitudes and Behaviors on Organ Donation
 Social media data relating to organ donation since 2008 
Open to ideas and suggestions for the topic, there are a lot of interesting questions to investigate including cultural/racial/gender differences in organ donation.  I have several preliminary reports and exploratory analysis done on differences in donors.

Second Meeting Thursday, June 11th 4:15 in the coffee shop!

Matching Game
Rules for the matching game:

Objective: Create the largest chain possible using blood types in the room.

Follow the blood type guidelines for donation to form a donor chain.  

Assume that self-matches are not possible, for example someone with a donor of type AB and a recipient of type AB can not match themselves and needs to find someone else to complete their chain.
Create a donor chain to help as many people as possible. 
Post results below for the prize
There will be several "good samaritan" donors which will donate and need nothing in return, this is a great way to start your chain.  Using a good samaritan chain also means you don't need a donor for the end point.
