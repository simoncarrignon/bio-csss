The narrative approach and it causality is different from causality in logico-scientific approaches. Making bridges among methodologies transfers knowledge, encourages important questions and switches philosophical paradigms. Formal frameworks of C(A)S can realy be complemented with the narrative, and actually should. The narrative approaches in Complexity Science are an emerging trend for fund-granting, and is really up to date to process documentary  and speech-based data, reveal hidden meanings, distinguish causes from effects in overlapping systems of realms - "at the edge" of technology, social, economic, scientific, legal and other domains. The role of time in coding, intuitively generated conditional rules and computational paths. Combinations of C(A)S and the narrative is combination of quantitative and qualitative data and thinking in original - out of convertation and information loss. Synthesis of sciences is what it is about.

Questions: 
How to combine CS approaches (in particular CAS) and the narrative ones in a rule-based way? What to start from? What vizualizations there can be designed and used? Other questions at your descrete.
