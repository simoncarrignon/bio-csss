One of the biggest difficulties ecologists face is trying to understand the ecosystem dynamics based on very little biological information (compared to the size of the system) - observational data is logistically difficult and can be very expensive to acquire, as well as often being very time consuming. In terms of modelling, to overcome this problem, two approaches have been utilised. 

The first is a network based approach whereby the nodes represent biomass density of a particular species (or a higher level taxanomic group and/or resources) and edges as the trophic interactions (who eats who). This method depends on what we know about the trophic behaviour of the species involved (which is often very limited and there can be many species to parameterise), and represents only the central tendency of what could potentially be very diverse behaviour within and between populations. 

The second approach is to use scaling theory to describe average trophic interactions and other biological processes based on individual organism body size along the size continuum, viewing the community as a very size structured dynamical system. This requires less specific knowledge about the organisms in the community per se, however this again represents only the central tendency of a given size class of what could be very diverse behaviour. Functional differences can be potentially introduced (coupled benthic-pelagic systems for example), but to the detriment of braking down the predictability of the well known allometric scaling laws with size as specificity increases. 

There has been little to no comparison of these two methods of modelling ecological systems (at least to my knowledge) and the question arises that, given the same starting information, how well do both approaches model the dynamics of an ecosystem, given the limited biological information we have? Is one approach better at capturing energy flow through the system / community structure and stability etc. compared to the other? If the models vary then such information will better inform ecologists on which to use depending on what type of questions they are trying to answer.

Therefore, the project proposed here aims to investigate these two methods. The community that is used to seed an experimental mesocosm setup (mesocosms are large tank set-ups designed to reflect the complexity of natural ecosystems but still being able to be artificially controlled and are still relatively simple), will be input into two models based on the separate approaches and then run to steady state. The model outputs will then be compared and contrasted with eachother as well as the mesocosm community at steady state. Further work may include examining perturbation dynamics, dependent on what data we have available.
