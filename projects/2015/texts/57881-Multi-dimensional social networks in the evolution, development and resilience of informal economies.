Informal economies are defined as economic activities that occur outside the purview of corporate public and private institutions. These types of economies proliferate where traditional economic actors are unable to productively exercise their activities, especially due to costly constraints (De Soto 2003). Firms may face adverse incentives to expand production by hiring more workers or incorporating more capital due to the low productivity of their workers or the predatory practices of rapacious elites or corrupt governments. Labor itself, i.e. people, may face hurdles in trying to make the jump towards entrepreneurial activities or jobs in the formal economy which allow the accumulation of experience, retirement savings, access to insurance or precautionary savings to face unexpected events (like disease, disability, etc.) due to lack of capital access (whether human and financial). 

For this project, we propose a different interpretation: We seek to understand and model how multi-faceted social networks provide robust alternatives to formal economies, which far from being seen as degenerate forms of social organization, in many instances co-exist, challenge and compete with formal employment and economic activities. While some types of informal economies operate under adverse contexts, their resiliency may be understood as a type of adaptive fitness and not the mere result of stubborn cultural path-dependency. 

For the most part, informal economies have been analysed as counterpoint to an ideal type of a formal economy with low levels of trust, respect of property rights, access to credit and public institutions - like the court systems (see Losby et al. 2002 for a review). However, informal economies have been coupled with their formal counterparts since the development of capitalism in the 19th Century. To name a famous historical example, Old London's East End's informal sector was described harshly by Engels (1844) in his famous tract, "The Condition of the Working Class in England". But almost fifty years later, in a new preface to the book, Engels recognized the progress that took place there under the aegis of working class organizations in the area. 

Research has begun to catch on to this idea – developing a literature in the areas of informal risk sharing and remittances, which are in some sense informal counterparts to insurance and banking. Consumption patterns in poor, rural villages are remarkably smooth suggesting that risk-sharing measures are prevalent, although imperfect (Townsend). Field studies of networks underlying village risk sharing systems have found that households primarily receive help from existing social connections, such as friends and relatives, in the form of informal loans or transfers. Theoretical work in network economics, by authors such as Matt Jackson, found that certain empirically prevalent network structures may directly benefit the stability of favor exchange systems. Another line of inquiry focuses on remittance income, generally informal transfers across kinship ties. World Bank researchers have found that remittances from overseas migrants respond dramatically to regional income shocks, replacing upwards of 60% of lost income in households with international migrants. Further studies, cited below, have generalized those results. Furthermore, reductions in the cost of sending remittances, which occurs with the advent of mobile money, further mitigates exposure to risk in receiving households.

Also recently, authors have written on how communities come together in situations where formal economies are unavailable by external shocks (like disasters) or due to lack of access (due to conditions of abject poverty). In the case of the latter, Venkatesh (2008) provided gripping testimonies of how informal economies arose and developed in the South Side of Chicago in low trust environments via cash transactions and informal service contracts enforced by (and for the benefit of) local criminal gangs. These gangs were seen, surprisingly, as alternative coordinating mechanisms to settle claims between neighbors. In the case of the former, Storr and Grube (2013) in a series of papers has argued how "shared histories and perspectives, and the stability of social networks within the community" allows communities who suffered disasters to cope and endogenously resolve immediate and complex problems. Providing an example of these social networks in action, research has found that remittances flow quickly into areas affected by natural disasters when there is a technology in place for it to happen.

Taking these lines of inquiry together, the findings suggest that informal handling of risk takes place on a large scale and that social networks informally connect communities in ways that impact their economies. Recent trends suggest that the interaction of formal and informal economic processes is growing on a nationwide scale. First, the aggregate value of remittance flows is large and growing, nearing the value of foreign direct investment. Second, advancements that formalize previously informal transactions are expanding dramatically in emerging economies through various forms of branchless banking. National economies may be embedded in profoundly influential informal systems that have never been holistically studied.

On a more general note, this project touches lingering questions in economics. For example, some might argue that more stringent labor regulations should have increased informal employment, but in fact the opposite happened. And while the economic rationale for the former statement remains valid, we suggest that unions, as other types of social organizations, as examples of ways whereas people interact via organized networks, provide richer dimensions than those suggested by their interaction as mere economic agents. Hence, unions, as well as other types of faith-based, ethnic, community and other interest groups may provide ways of interaction that escape narrow economic outcomes.
