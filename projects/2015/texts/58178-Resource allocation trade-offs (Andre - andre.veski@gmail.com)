Using evolutionary algorithms to investigate trade-offs in allocating goods among agents. This could be potentially done on some real dataset (if you have any) or somehow parametrized synthetic data. Also this could be envisioned as a strategic bargaining between agents, which would introduce some dynamics into the process.
